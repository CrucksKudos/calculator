# Simple Calculator

This is a project from **The Odin Project** curriculum, where I created an on-screen calculator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal was to practice JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS layout techniques while building a fully functional calculator.

## Project Overview

The calculator implements basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with a user-friendly interface. Users can interact with the calculator either by clicking the on-screen buttons or by using the keyboard. The project also includes extra functionalities such as handling decimal inputs, backspace deletion, and toggling positive/negative values, along with visual feedback effects like blinking buttons.

## Features of the Calculator

- **Display Screen**: Shows the current number being entered, the selected operator, and the final result.
- **Numeric Buttons**: Buttons for digits (0-9) that allow users to input numbers.
- **Operator Buttons**: Buttons for basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`) that execute the corresponding calculations.
- **Decimal & Equal Buttons**: A decimal point button for floating-point input and an equal button to finalize and display the result.
- **Additional Controls**: 
  - **Clear (AC)**: Resets the entire calculator.
  - **Backspace (âŒ«)**: Deletes the last digit entered.
  - **Positive/Negative Toggle (+/-)**: Changes the sign of the current number.
- **Keyboard Support**: Enables using the keyboard to perform operations. The corresponding on-screen button blinks when its key is pressed, providing immediate visual feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a snarky error message (e.g., "LOL") when attempting to divide by zero.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To build the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: To style the calculator interface and create a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the logic for arithmetic operations, manage user input, and handle events.
- **Git**: For version control during development.
- **The Odin Project Curriculum**: As the framework and source of guidance throughout the project.
